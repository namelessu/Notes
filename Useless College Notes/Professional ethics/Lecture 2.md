1. **Level one :** Whatever benefits oneself or avoids punishment
2. **Level two:** Acceptance of societyâ€™s rules
3. **Level three :** Moral autonomy (self-rule)
## **Moral autonomy**
- It when the person creates his principles based on what is right or what is wrong and understand that not all what is legal is moral and not all what the society creates from rules is always right. 
- They always do what is right to respect the one's self and others and what is morally reasonable for one's self.
## The principle of Right & Wrong
- The most essential principle in ethics is to understand the aspect of right and wrong independent of culture or society or law.

- **Self-restraint (emotions):** control attraction to positive emotions.
- **Determination (emotions):** control dislike for negative emotions.
